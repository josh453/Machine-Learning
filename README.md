# Machine learning with MNIST Handwritten Digits

My goal for these projects is to better understand and implement various classification techniques using the MNIST data set. The MNIST data has a training set of 60,000 examples and test set of 10,000 examples. The notebooks have functions to download the data sets, data can also be found in this repo or the [MNIST site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Pre-requisites
Built using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebooks.

This project uses the following packages:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* URLretrieve
